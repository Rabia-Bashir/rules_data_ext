Instructions for running the scripts:

> Run Cochrane_Bot.py to extract the data from Cochrane systematic reviews (.pub2) and their updates (.pub3). The script needs list of DOI for these systematic reviews and 
  their updates to send request to server

> After request, all reviews and their updates are stored in a folder 'HTML_SystematicReviews' before starting the feature extraction process.
> The extracted features will be stored in write_data.csv file

> Run random_forest.csv file to draw random forest and calculate precision, recall and f1-score. The script needs input (extracted features) to draw a random forest classifier to model the risk of conclusion change in
  review updates, and AutoExt_Data.csv contains a cleaned list of extracted features used for this purpose

> Random forest will be drawn in forest.png
