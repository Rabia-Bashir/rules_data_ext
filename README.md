# Automatic_DataExtraction_Rules
The code uses Cochrane systematic reviews and their updates for automatically extracting the features (number of participants, total number of included trials, search dates and conclusions). For rules (regular expressions) development and web scraping, Pythgon 3.7 and Beautiful Soup library is used. The figure Steps_AutomaticExtraction.png represents the steps involved in information extraction.
